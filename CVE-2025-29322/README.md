## Vulnerability Description

A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in ScriptCase versions prior to v1.0.003 - Build 3. Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code via the "Connection Name" field in the New Connection and Rename Connection pages. The malicious payload is stored in the application's database and executed whenever a user accesses these pages, leading to unauthorized code execution in the context of the victim's session.

## Affected Component

Rename Connection Page: scriptcase/prod/lib/php/devel/iface/db_rename.php

## Impact

Arbitrary Code Execution: Attackers can execute JavaScript in the victim's browser.

Session Hijacking: Steal cookies (e.g., PHPSESSID) to impersonate users.

Privilege Escalation: Compromise admin accounts if exploited by low-privileged users.

Information Disclosure: Exfiltrate sensitive data (e.g., database credentials).
